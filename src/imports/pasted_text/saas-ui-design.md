Objective:
Design a professional, high-fidelity UI for a SaaS platform that leverages AI to transform long-form video content into various marketing assets. The design should be modern, intuitive, and follow a dark mode theme with orange as the primary brand color.
Overall Style & Branding:
Theme: Dark Mode. Use a dark charcoal gray (#2C2C2E) as the primary background color.
Brand Color: Vibrant orange (#FF6A00) for all primary actions, highlights, and interactive elements.
Typography: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font like 'Inter' or 'Poppins'. Ensure high contrast between text and the dark background (use white #FFFFFF for headings and light gray #E5E7EB for body text).
Aesthetics: Professional, sleek, and tech-forward. Use subtle shadows, rounded corners on cards and inputs, and clear visual hierarchy.
Core Pages & Workflow to Design:
1. Dashboard / Landing Page (Inspired by Jasper.ai)
Layout:
Left Sidebar: A fixed vertical navigation menu with the platform logo at the top. Include menu items like: "Dashboard", "My Projects", "Templates", "Integrations", "Settings". Use the brand orange for the active menu item indicator.
Main Content Area: A clean, scrollable space.
Content:
At the top, a welcome message like "Hi [Username], what would you like to create today?"
Below the message, display "Featured Categories" as a horizontal scroll of cards.
Cards: Design a card component with a light gray border, rounded corners, and a subtle hover effect (slight scale-up and shadow increase). Each card represents a content creation workflow.
Key Card: Create a prominent card titled "From Video". This card should stand out slightly (e.g., with a thin orange border). When clicked, it triggers the content creation workflow modal.
2. Content Creation Workflow (Step-by-Step Modal)
Design a large, centered modal window with a dark background and a bright orange header. The modal should guide the user through 3 steps.
Step 1: Video Input
Title: "Step 1: Upload Your Video"
Content:
A large, dashed border upload zone in the center with an icon (e.g., a cloud/upload icon in orange). Inside the zone, text reads "Drag & drop your MP4 video here, or click to browse".
Below the zone, a secondary option: "Or enter a video URL (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)" with a text input field.
A "Next" button at the bottom right (disabled until a video is uploaded/URL is entered).
Step 2: Content Generation Options
Title: "Step 2: Choose Your Content"
Content: Display a series of option cards or toggles for the user to select what to generate.
Option 1: Blog Post
A toggle switch to enable/disable.
When enabled, show a dropdown or select input: "Estimated Read Time" with options like "3 min read", "5 min read", "10 min read".
Option 2: Short Videos
A toggle switch to enable/disable.
When enabled, show two number input fields:
"Number of Videos": (default: 10)
"Duration per Video (seconds)": (default: 30)
Option 3: Highlight Reel
A toggle switch to enable/disable.
When enabled, show a number input field: "Duration (minutes)": (default: 10)
A "Generate" button at the bottom right (only enabled if at least one option is selected).
Step 3: Processing & Review
Title: "Generating Your Content..."
Content:
A loading animation (e.g., an orange spinning circle or a progress bar).
Text: "This may take a few minutes. We're analyzing your video and crafting your content."
Once generation is complete, the modal should automatically transition to the Content Review Page (see below).
3. Content Review & Editing Page
This page replaces the modal and becomes the main content area.
Layout: A multi-section layout displaying all generated content.
Sections:
Section 1: Blog Post
A card containing the generated blog post title and a preview of the text.
Buttons below: "Edit", "Approve", "Regenerate".
Clicking "Edit" should open a simple text editor within the card for the user to make final adjustments.
Section 2: Short Videos
A grid or list of video thumbnails (10 in total).
Each video thumbnail should have a small "Trim" button overlay (e.g., a scissor icon). Clicking it opens a minimal trimmer interface (start/end sliders).
Above the grid, bulk action buttons: "Approve All", "Select All".
Each video card should also have individual "Approve" and "Delete" buttons.
Section 3: Highlight Reel
A larger video player showing the 10-minute highlight reel.
Buttons below: "Trim", "Approve", "Regenerate".
Final Action: A prominent orange "Finalize & Export" button at the top right of the page, which becomes enabled only when all generated items are approved.
Reference Images:
Use the layout structure from the Jasper.ai screenshot (Image 2) for the main dashboard, specifically the left sidebar and card-based content area.
Use the dark mode aesthetic and UI element styling from the chat app screenshot (Image 3) as inspiration for the overall look and feel (shadows, rounded corners, color palette).
The first image can be ignored as it's unrelated to the core UI.
Design Requirements:
Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, toggles, inputs) have clear hover and active states using the brand orange.
The design must be responsive and look clean on desktop screens.
Focus on creating a seamless and intuitive flow from video upload to final content approval.
